# Final

Aims and Objectives


In this assessment, I will code a game in Python 3 kernel with mechanics similar to “Angry Birds”, in which users can enter the parameters of initial velocity, which are its angle  with the horizontal ground and its magnitude , to launch a projectile at a target to try to topple it. In order to do this, I am going to write the codes for:

• showing the path of the projectile;

• calculating the momentum of the object at the point of collision with the target, the impulse transferred to the target as well as the torque applying to the target due to the collision, and whether or not this is greater than the restoring torque to make target be toppled.

• showing the animation of the whole process.
